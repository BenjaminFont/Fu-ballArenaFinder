# Goal

Currently, there are many websites in Stuttgart where you can book football courts. It's
not very practical to have to check availability on every single one of them, hence this project was
born.

The goal is to have Github Actions to scrape websites which allow you to book football courts in
Stuttgart. We then use this parsed data to offer all information unified in a single frontend, where
you have a full view of the availability of all courts for the day/week.

The actions should execute once every x minutes in order to keep the view updated. The frontend will be served through Github Pages, therefore not requiring any backend server to use it.
